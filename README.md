## Semantic versioning

A version consists of three parts: **MAJOR**.**MINOR**.**PATCH**. Version 1.2.3 of a package could be referred to as a package on major version 1, minor version 2, patchlevel 3.
  
**Major**: contains breaking changes, compared to the previous release. Consumers of our package need to make adjustments to their existing code integrating this package.
  
**Minor**: contains added functionality (e.g. new methods) which do not break existing functionality. Consumers of our package do not need to make adjustments to their existing code integrating this package.
  
**Patchlevel**: contains bug fixes, upgraded dependencies, etc. but does not contain new functionality. Consumers of our package do not need to make adjustments to their existing code integrating this package.
